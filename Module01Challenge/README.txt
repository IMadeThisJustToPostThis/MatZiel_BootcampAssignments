Programmer: Mateusz Zielinski

This repository file contains all necessary files for the module01 challenge, in which we must refactor
a pre-made HTML page to fit the clients requested changes. It wasn't a part of the assignment, but I also
added an extra class for the hero-image so that it displays properly even when the browser window is resized

Note: the edited files end in my initials: MZ
